# Raspberry-Pi-SHT31-D-Humidity-Sensor
Raspberry Pi SHT31-D Humidity Sensor for raspberry pi 


Python Installation of SHT31D Library
You'll need to install the Adafruit_Blinka library that provides the CircuitPython support in Python. This may also require enabling I2C on your platform and verifying you are running Python 3. Since each platform is a little different, and Linux changes often, please visit the CircuitPython on Linux guide to get your computer ready!

Once that's done, from your command line run the following command:

sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-sht31d
